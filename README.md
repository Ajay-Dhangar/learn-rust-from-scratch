## Getting Started with Rust

### Installing Rust on Windows, macOS, and Linux 

To get started with Rust, you need to install it on your system. Rust is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the installer for your operating system from the official Rust website. Once you have downloaded the installer, you can run it to install Rust on your system.

### Hello, World!

Once you have installed Rust on your system, you can create your first Rust program. Open your favorite text editor and create a new file called `main.rs`. In this file, write the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Save the file and open a terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run the following command:

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
```

This will compile your Rust program and create an executable file called `main`. You can run this file by running the following command:

```bash
$ ./main
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have written and run your first Rust program.
